# Assignment-3-Part-2-NGINX

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will extend your previous NGINX setup by configuring two new servers and a load balancer. You will create two Digital Ocean droplets running Arch Linux, set up a load balancer to distribute traffic, clone updated starter code, and update the server configuration to include a file server. This will ensure that your web application is highly available and can serve documents from both servers.

## Task 1: Create Digital Ocean Droplets
Create two Arch Linux droplets tagged "web".

## Task 2: Setup Load Balancer
Create a public-facing load balancer to distribute traffic between the two servers.
- **Region**: SFO3
- **VPC**: Default
- **Tag**: "web"

## Task 3: Clone Updated Starter Code
Clone the updated starter code repository containing a script to generate an HTML document.

## Task 4: Update Server Configuration
Update server configuration to include a file server accessible at `your-ip/documents`.
```
/var/lib/webgen
├── bin/
│   └── generate_index
├── documents/
│   ├── file-one
│   └── file-two
└── HTML/
    └── index.html
```
- `index.html` is generated by `generate_index`.
- `file-one` and `file-two` are sample files.
