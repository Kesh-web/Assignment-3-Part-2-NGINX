# Assignment-3-Part-2-NGINX

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will extend your previous NGINX setup by configuring two new servers and a load balancer. You will create two Digital Ocean droplets running Arch Linux, set up a load balancer to distribute traffic, clone updated starter code, and update the server configuration to include a file server. This will ensure that your web application is highly available and can serve documents from both servers. The list below is all the tasks to be completed during this assignment.

- Create two Arch Linux droplets tagged "web".

- Create a public-facing load balancer to distribute traffic between the two servers.
    - **Region**: SFO3
    - **VPC**: Default
    - **Tag**: "web"

- Clone the updated starter code repository containing a script to generate an HTML document.

- Update server configuration to include a file server accessible at `your-ip/documents`.
```
/var/lib/webgen
├── bin/
│   └── generate_index
├── documents/
│   ├── file-one
│   └── file-two
└── HTML/
    └── index.html
```
- `index.html` is generated by `generate_index`.
- `file-one` and `file-two` are sample files.

## Task 1: Create Two New Digital Ocean Droplets

Create two new Digital Ocean droplets running Arch Linux with the tag "web". You will use this tag when you set up your load balancer.

1. Navigate to the "Droplets" section in the control panel.
2. Click on the "Create Droplet" button.
3. Choose "Arch Linux" as the operating system.
4. Select the droplet size based on your requirements (e.g., Standard, General Purpose).
5. Make sure to choose the data center region of SFO3 (San Francisco Datacenter 3).

6. Under "Authentication", select your preferred method (e.g., SSH keys).
7. Add the tag "web" to the droplet.

8. Repeat the above steps to create the second droplet.
9. Verify that both droplets are running. To verify it should look like the image below with the green indictor meaning its active and the tag web being displayed

## Task 2: Create a Load Balancer

Create a load balancer to distribute traffic between the two servers created in Task 1. The load balancer should configured with the settings listed below.

2. Navigate to the "Load Balancers" section in the control panel.
3. Click on the "Create Load Balancer" button.
4. Configure the load balancer with the following settings:
    - **Region**: SFO3 (same as your servers)
    - **VPC**: Default (same as your servers)
    - **Type**: External (public)
5. Under "Forwarding Rules", set the following to these, but they should already be the default settings.
    - **Protocol**: HTTP
    - **Port**: 80
    - **Target Protocol**: HTTP
    - **Target Port**: 80
6. Under "Backend", use the "web" tag to load balance all servers with the "web" tag in the SFO3 region.

7. Click on the "Create Load Balancer" button to finalize the setup.
8. Verify that the load balancer have been created. 

> **Note**: The load balancer will show that the servers are down until you set up the NGINX servers within the new droplets.
